1. Explain the concepts and Gaussian NB algorithm. 

NB algorithm - Naive Bayes is a group of classification algorithm that is based on Bayes' theorem. 
Bayes' provides a trustworthy way for calculating a conditional probability.
The theorem allows us to update the prior belief of an event X given a new piece of information Y. 

In the Gaussian NB the assumption is that data from each label is drawn from a simple Gaussian distribution.

What are the pros and cons of the Gaussian NB algorithm?

PROS:
+ Fast
+ Simple
+ Suitable for high-dimensional datasets / many categories with clear distinction
+ Few tunable parameters (easy to use)
+ Baseline for classification problems

CONS:
- Too simple for many cases
- Assumes that the features are independent (Naive)
- Isn't suitable if the data isn't drawn from Gaussian distribution.
