---- PART 3 ----

1. Modify the script in order to reshuffle the rows of the data set to randomize the cross
validation folds before applying the cross validation.
Run again the script but on the reshuffled data set and re-calculate the MSE and R2
scores. Do you obtain a better performance?

-	YES! There is a partition bias in the unshuffled data which gives a worse mean than if the data is shuffled.
	If a training fold consist of only one category, the test data will get a bad result


2. What happens if you do reshuffle and RFE? do you get better results than only reshuffling?

- Some got better values while some got worse

3. Find out if there are ML algorithms that perform better on the data cars.csv data set.
