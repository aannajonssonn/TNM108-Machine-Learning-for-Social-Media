---- PART 2 ----

1. How many clusters do you have? Explain your answer.
    We have five clusters. 
    When looking at the dendogram, we draw a horizontal line at y ~ 150, that passes through 5 vertical lines.

2. Plot the clusters to see how actually the data has been clustered.  
    Done.

3. What can you conclude by looking at the plot?
    The x-axis represent the annual income ($k) and the y-axis the spending score (1-100).
    The middle income class is most consistent with their spending, and their spending score is about 40-60.

    The higher income class have two different groups, one that spends alot (60-90), and one that spends less (0-40). 
    The same for the lower income class.
