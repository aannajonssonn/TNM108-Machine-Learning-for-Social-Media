---- PART 3 ----

1. Can you choose n_components=2? Can you think of some method to test this?

    Yes. 
    We order the variables by their variance, and pick the two with the highest variance. 
    This can be done with pythons own variance function.
    Variance Ratio:  [0.60950217 0.2611802  0.12931763]
    Which gives us that the two variables with highest variance makes up about 86% of the total variance.
    

2. Create the scatter plot of the third principal component (that is, you combine the third
principal component with the first and then the second principal component). What can
you see with the plot? What is the difference?

    The axis is now longer (20,20) and some points have more extreme values, making them easier to make out. 


3. Can you tell which feature contribute more towards the 1st PC?

    Mean concave points 
    Mean concavity
    Worst concave points
