---- PART 1 ----

 1. What are the relevant features of the Titanic dataset? Why are they relevant?
    
    The dataset contains information about the passengers on the Titanic. 
    The information can be used to compare the passengers and see which ones had a higher chance of surviving.
    The relevant features are the age, sex, ticket class, and if they survived or not. 
    As well as amount of siblings and spouses or parents and children onboard the titanic, 
    the passengers ticket number and fare, cabin number, and port of embarkation.

 2. Can you find a parameter configuration to get a validation score greater than 62%?

    No, we cannot get a validation score greater than 62% with the parameters we have tried.
    We have tried the elkan algorithm and different values on max_iter.

    The validation score is 62.6%

 3. What are the advantages/ disadvantages of K-Means clustering?

    Advantages: 
   + Easy to implement.
   + Scales to large data sets.
   + Faster than hierarchical clustering.
   
   Disadvantages:
   - Requires the number of clusters to be known or pre-specified.
   - Sensitive to outliers, results can change with the ordering of the data.
   - Only works when triggered, can result in different results for different runs.        ?Vad menas med detta?
   - Requires quite large amount of memory to store the data.
   - Each request has to identify the local model from scratch. 


 4. How can you address the weaknesses?

    - Before specifying the number of clusters, you could look at the data points and try to find a natural number of clusters.
    - Take a look at the outliers and see if they can be removed or if they should be included in the clusters.
